=============

cytometree is a package which performs automatic gating of cytometry data.

The algorithm is based on the construction of a binary tree, the nodes of which are subpopulations of cells. At each node, observed cells and markers are modeled by both a family of normal and a family of normal mixture distributions. Splitting is done according to a normalized difference of AIC between the two families. Given the unsupervised nature of the binary tree, some of the available markers may not be used to find the different cell populations present in a given sample. To recover a complete annotation, we defined, as a post processing procedure, an annotation method which allows the user to distinguish two or three expression levels per marker.
